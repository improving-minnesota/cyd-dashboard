# User guide (printable tri-fold)

`DEVELOPER-USERGUIDE.md` is the source of truth for both GitHub and the
printed handout. `render_userguide.py` converts it to styled HTML and prints
`DEVELOPER-USERGUIDE.pdf` via headless Chrome — a 2-page Letter-landscape
sheet meant for duplex printing and a standard letter fold (three panels
per side, six total).

## Files

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `DEVELOPER-USERGUIDE.md` | Source content — edit this, never the PDF |
| `render_userguide.py` | Markdown -> HTML -> PDF pipeline + all CSS |
| `DEVELOPER-USERGUIDE.pdf` | Generated output (2 pages expected) |
| `cyd-horizon-guide-logo.svg` | Front-cover logo source — derived from the 2.8" packaging cover (middle band only: title, slogan, divider, radar/emblem, bullets; no top/bottom bars or separators) |
| `cyd-horizon-guide-logo.png` | Generated raster used by the guide |
| `render_dash_mock.py` | Regenerates the simulated screenshots |
| `mock_data.json` | Cached data for the mock screens (`--refresh` re-pulls) |
| `fetch_backgrounds.py` | One-time generator for `bg-*.png` page art |
| `bg-blur.png` / `bg-leaf.png` / `bg-lines.png` | Saved page backgrounds |

## Regenerating

```sh
cyd-horizon/.venv/bin/python docs/user-guide/render_userguide.py
```

Run from the repo root. Requires the `markdown` package and Google Chrome
at `/Applications/Google Chrome.app/...`. The script also re-renders the
dashboard screenshots first (cached `mock_data.json`; pass `--refresh` to
re-pull live data). It refuses to render if `.release-please-manifest.json`
is stale vs `origin/main`, and warns if the PDF is not exactly 2 pages.

After editing the cover logo SVG, re-render its PNG before rebuilding:

```sh
cyd-horizon/.venv/bin/python -c "import cairosvg; \
  cairosvg.svg2png(url='docs/user-guide/cyd-horizon-guide-logo.svg', \
  write_to='docs/user-guide/cyd-horizon-guide-logo.png', \
  output_width=2700, output_height=1220)"
```

## Markdown structure

- `<!-- SIDE:OUTSIDE -->` / `<!-- SIDE:INSIDE -->` split the two printed
  sides; `<!-- PANEL -->` splits each side's three panels, listed in printed
  left-to-right order. OUTSIDE = `[inside flap | back cover | front cover]`
  (front cover is last).
- `{{VERSION}}` on the cover is replaced with the firmware version (next
  patch of the manifest, e.g. `Firmware v3.5.1+`).
- Images use relative paths resolved against this folder (`.png`, `.svg`,
  `.jpg`).
- All `##` section headings use title case (major words capitalized —
  e.g. `Settings at a Glance`, `LED & Border Colors`).
- `.callout` — light-blue note card (navy text, `#7da8c8` border) for
  hardware notes that need emphasis, e.g. the external-speaker paragraph.
  Lighter than the dark `h2` bars so it can't be mistaken for a heading.
  `.warn` remains the red caution variant. Nested `<div>`s do NOT process
  markdown — write inner markup as explicit HTML (`<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`).

## Front-cover conventions (for agents)

- The logo is rendered at `width: 88%` to match the `.hero` screenshots —
  keep logo and screenshots the same width for symmetry.
- The logo SVG is a vertically-trimmed `cyd-2.8-cover-4.5x2.25.svg`
  (1350x610): dark banner, borders, radar+emblem, and the five feature
  bullets are all part of the artwork — the feature bullets live in the
  logo, not in the markdown. If the cover artwork changes, re-derive the
  guide logo the same way (drop the top bar, bottom bar, and both
  separators; re-wrap the borders around the middle band).
- The `.desc` card under the logo uses the same light-blue card style as
  `.callout` (`box-sizing: border-box` keeps it at 88% like the shots);
  text is left-aligned, boards listed as plain `<ul>` bullets.
- `.cover-bottom` groups the version pill and GitHub link as one flex item
  so they stay adjacent; `.cover` uses `justify-content: space-between`
  for even gaps between the remaining blocks.
- Both hero screenshots (`-dashboard.png`, `-wxgraph.png`) must fit the
  cover panel — the CSS keeps them single-line spaced; if the PDF grows
  past 2 pages, tighten `.cover` margins/font, not the panel order.
- Per AGENTS.md: user-facing guide changes ride along with `README.md` and
  `kHelpLines[]` in `cyd-horizon/settings.ino`.
